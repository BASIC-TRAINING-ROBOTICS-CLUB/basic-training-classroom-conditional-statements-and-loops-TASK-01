Full Adder Implementation

Create a C program that implements a full adder. 
The full adder adds three binary inputs (two significant bits and one carry-in) and produces two outputs: sum and carry-out.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
