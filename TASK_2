Task: Create a program to calculate the range, maximum height, and time of flight for a projectile given the initial velocity and angle of projection. 
Ensure the program correctly handles angle conversions and provides accurate results.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
